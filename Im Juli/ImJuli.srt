1
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:54,323
Excuse me.

2
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:01,829
Who are you? What d'you want?
Why the hell do you speak German?

3
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:03,901
What?
- What d'you want?

4
00:03:04,342 --> 00:03:08,540
I'm a hitchhiker, and I just wanted
to ask you for a lift. That's all.

5
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:10,471
Calm down.

6
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:18,483
Damn it!

7
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,001
Goddamn it! Fucking shit! Fuck!

8
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,885
Fucking shit! Goddamn it!

9
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:59,487
Oh crap! Goddamn it!

10
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:07,431
Hey, man! I'm taIking to you!

11
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:12,333
Goddamn it! C'mon!
We gotta get outta here!

12
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:14,070
C'mon!

13
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,464
Goddamn fucking shit!

14
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,302
How the hell did I get
into such a fucking mess?

15
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,504
As if one dead body wasn't enough! Now
I got two fucking bodies to deal with!

16
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:47,775
What did you say?

17
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:51,576
You're okay?

18
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,609
Yeah, I'm okay.
- Fine. Get out!

19
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:58,178
Ow! I think something's wrong
with my neck!

20
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:00,454
I said GET OUT!

21
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:02,723
Now listen here.

22
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:06,097
You almost killed me, but I'm alive,
and you're glad I am.

23
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:10,331
So why don't you show me
and give me a lift?

24
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,162
Please.

25
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:18,566
Okay.

26
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:22,673
Come up front.
- Okay.

27
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:53,268
Yeah, sure!

28
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,951
My name's Daniel.

29
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:04,020
Isa.

30
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,458
So, Daniel.

31
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,629
Where are you from?

32
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:14,096
Hamburg.

33
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,655
Hamburg!

34
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:19,399
I got an aunt who lives in Hamburg.

35
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:23,033
How do you earn a living?

36
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,669
I'm a student teacher.

37
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:30,608
I'm gonna be a teacher.
- A teacher? ... You?

38
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:34,018
Yeah. - Shit, kiddo.
You sure don't look like a teacher.

39
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:35,384
How do I look?

40
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:38,916
Don't know. More like a bum.

41
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,455
Going to the fucking south?

42
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,225
To Turk country, man!
- Oh, I see. Yeah.

43
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,532
Going on vacation?

44
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:53,626
Nope.

45
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,106
I'm after a girl.

46
00:06:58,677 --> 00:06:59,575
Your wife?

47
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,268
Nope.

48
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:05,715
You're in love?

49
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:09,381
Cool! Tell me all about it.

50
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:15,250
It's quite a long story.

51
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:19,588
Hey, we got a long way to go, man.

52
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,896
By applying Newton's law to the problem,

53
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:33,242
we see that velocity
is the most important factor.

54
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:37,910
How fast must ''x'' be accelerated
on a ramp with an incline of 10 degrees,

55
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:43,412
in order to overcome
25 meters of gravitational force?

56
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,087
Anette?

57
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,759
Don't you see I'm talking to someone?

58
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:00,632
Ernie?

59
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:02,198
No idea, man!

60
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:05,573
Kira?

61
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,571
Mr. Bannier, we can't have a normal
lesson the last hour before vacation!

62
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,942
What else?

63
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:15,079
School's out!

64
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:25,157
Goodbye, Mr. Bannier.
- Bye, Kira.

65
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,162
Have a nice vacation.

66
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:34,603
What? He passes here every day,
and you haven't spoken to him yet?

67
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,603
I've been too shy.

68
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,840
You? Shy?

69
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:40,776
Oh boy!

70
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,848
That's him!

71
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,617
The one with the glasses!

72
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:52,420
Talk to him! Go on!

73
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:01,664
Hey!

74
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:04,766
Come over here.

75
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,368
You look like you could use some luck.

76
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:15,370
A bag would do.

77
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,475
What's this?

78
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:19,114
A sun.

79
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:20,382
What's a sun?

80
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:26,013
It's a ball of gas which the Earth and
the other 8 planets revolve around.

81
00:09:26,457 --> 00:09:28,948
The sun lights up life: for me,

82
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,588
for her and for you.

83
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:32,591
Another word for light is ...?

84
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:33,827
Energy?

85
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:35,562
It's good luck.

86
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,763
I see. The ring is a lucky charm.

87
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,396
You're very smart.
- I'll be a teacher soon.

88
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:43,865
A teacher? Really? That's funny.

89
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:46,703
What's your name?

90
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:49,171
Daniel. Daniel Bannier.

91
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:51,813
That's a nice name.

92
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:53,975
What's your name?

93
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:56,887
I'm July. - July?
- Like the month.

94
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,448
What about the ring?

95
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:05,222
It's a very old Mayan ring.

96
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:09,528
The legend says, whoever wears the ring
can recognize happiness.

97
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,399
You will soon meet a girl
wearing the same sun that you have.

98
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:20,272
She is the only person who is destined
to bring you happiness.

99
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,513
How much?
- 50.

100
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,580
Don't you like it?

101
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:26,949
Sure, but ...

102
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:29,479
Then why don't you fight for it?

103
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:34,185
Okay, 30.
- 40.

104
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:37,151
35. It's all I've got.
But I want the ring.

105
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:43,399
Okay, but ... only because I like you.

106
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:45,561
Thanks.

107
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:46,993
Wait a sec.

108
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,271
This is on tonight.
Why don't you stop by?

109
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:55,611
Thanks. - You're welcome.
- Looking forward to it.

110
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:57,207
I am, too!

111
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:58,843
Bye.
- Bye.

112
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,552
July?
- Yes.

113
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,961
What was that?
- That was Daniel Bannier.

114
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:17,925
Yeah, sure.

115
00:11:19,337 --> 00:11:21,066
But what's so special about him?

116
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:26,233
He has something deep inside
waiting to get out.

117
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,143
Like what?

118
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,350
Hey! First person singular, teacher!
- Hi, Kodjo.

119
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:56,268
Don't think so.
- Bikini and Zucchini!

120
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,244
Going on vacation?
- I'm staying in Hamburg. - Here? - Yep.

121
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:05,207
You aren't leaving? - No.
- You need some sun. - It's sunny here.

122
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:08,141
Could you water my plants then?
- Sure.

123
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:10,747
Every morning and every evening?
- Sure.

124
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:14,455
Hey, cool.
Here's my car key.

125
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,759
Feel free to use it.
- That ...

126
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:39,740
Excuse me!

127
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:41,537
Hey there!

128
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:45,942
Excuse me!

129
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:49,486
Can I have a beer, please?

130
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:55,987
Excuse me. Is that a sun?

131
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:57,585
What?

132
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:00,724
Is your amulet a sun?

133
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,531
No, it's a moon!

134
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:08,138
Excuse me! Could I have a ...

135
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:15,973
The next song is a love song.

136
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:20,111
About a love
that crossed over every border.

137
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:05,553
Hi, do you know
of a cheap place to spend the night?

138
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:10,561
I'm from Berlin.
I don't know my way around here.

139
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,501
No? Okay.

140
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,375
Hey, wait a minute!

141
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:24,610
Just a sec.
I was kind of gone for a moment.

142
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:30,886
I just remembered. There's this cheap,
small youth hostel nearby.

143
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:34,416
And if you'd like,
I'll show you the way.

144
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,761
You'd do that for me?
- Sure, no problem. I got a car.

145
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,687
That's nice of you.
- My car is over there.

146
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:44,061
I'm Daniel.
- Melek.

147
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:48,336
Melek. Nice name. Where's it from?
- Turkey.

148
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:51,674
Are you Turkish?
- Mmh. - Great.

149
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,703
Can I carry your bag?
- No, it's okay.

150
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,544
C'mon.
- It isn't heavy.

151
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:59,439
Sure, but you've carried it all day.
I'd like to carry it.

152
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:07,521
Hungry? - Huh?
- Are you hungry? - Yeah.

153
00:16:10,194 --> 00:16:11,559
I don't believe it.

154
00:16:17,468 --> 00:16:21,268
This is Istanbul ... the Bosporus.
Europe's on the left, Asia on the right.

155
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:24,971
I sometimes stand under the bridge
at night, watching the water.

156
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:29,709
When the moon sparkles on the water
then it looks like

157
00:16:30,147 --> 00:16:33,116
thousands of little fish dancing.
In Turkish there's a word for it:

158
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:34,813
''Yakamoz.''

159
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,692
I have a date right under the bridge
on Friday, at noon.

160
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:48,054
Aren't you going away?
- Huh?

161
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,401
Aren't you going away?
- No, I don't think so.

162
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:55,795
But everybody's going on vacation.
- Yeah, I know, but I've decided

163
00:16:56,173 --> 00:16:58,038
to stay in Hamburg.

164
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,936
Hamburg can be really nice
in the summer. There are lots of parks

165
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:07,215
and cafes and restaurants and all.
And there's the beach.

166
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:11,713
Hamburg has a beach?
- You didn't know? ... A real beach.

167
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:16,286
A real beach with sand
and water and seashells and all.

168
00:17:17,194 --> 00:17:19,492
Would you like to see it?
- Mmh.

169
00:17:20,264 --> 00:17:21,322
Okay.

170
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,633
The check, please.

171
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,372
Yeah, this is the beach. There aren't
that many seashells, but ...

172
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:35,707
Would you like a beer?
- Oh yeah. - Just a sec.

173
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:41,543
Excuse me, could one of you guys
sell me two beers?

174
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,344
Sure.

175
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,616
Here.
- Thanks. - Ciao.

176
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:50,483
How much do I owe you?

177
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,690
The best things in life are free.

178
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:55,957
Cheers.

179
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,403
I'm beginning to understand
why you don't want to leave.

180
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:19,078
My sun, my moon,
let your light shine.

181
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:25,892
My warm sand
will keep your path free.

182
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:34,927
I stroke your skin
with my wind.

183
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:41,670
My lips thirst for your lips.

184
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:49,810
Oh, your eyes ...

185
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:57,494
should look for me
and follow me.

186
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:05,964
Oh, your lips ...

187
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:12,943
should come and find me
and stay and kiss me.

188
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:26,181
Tell me. Your name ... Melek,

189
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,251
does it mean anything?

190
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:29,852
Angel.

191
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:33,329
It really suits you.

192
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:36,765
Thanks, but you don't even know me.

193
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:45,168
What about that place to sleep?

194
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:55,447
Do you live alone here?

195
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:58,811
Yep.

196
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,557
Don't you have a girlfriend?

197
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:05,286
Nope.

198
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:10,757
Would you like some tea?
- Sure.

199
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:13,571
It's really crazy
that we met today, because ...

200
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:16,506
It's really crazy
that we met today, because ...

201
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,976
I knew we'd meet today.

202
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:25,808
Maybe I didn't know it.
Maybe I was just hoping, but ...

203
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:31,252
It's as if you could
decide your own fate for one day.

204
00:20:32,423 --> 00:20:35,256
I stood there waiting for you, and ...

205
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:39,361
Then I thought you weren't coming.

206
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,191
And then you were there.

207
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,800
Melek?

208
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,828
Well, thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.

209
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:17,359
Bye, Daniel.

210
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:49,798
That's bullshit.
Why not wise up and stay here?

211
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:52,862
What for? I don't wanna stay here!
I hate this damn town!

212
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:56,102
Yeah, but where will you go?

213
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,107
Wherever the wind takes me.

214
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:00,443
What do you mean by that?

215
00:22:00,844 --> 00:22:02,675
I just wanna get away!

216
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,310
The first car that stops
will determine where I go.

217
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,186
What if the first car is going . .
to Bavaria?

218
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,646
You wanna live in Bavaria?

219
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,329
Okay, I guess that's my destiny.

220
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:28,500
I'm going to miss you.

221
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:30,538
I'll miss you, too.

222
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,455
Hi, July.

223
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,356
Hop in. I'm in a hurry.

224
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:14,375
Is this your car?
- No, it belongs to a friend.

225
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:18,182
Where can I drop you?

226
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,250
Where are you heading?

227
00:23:21,892 --> 00:23:22,859
Istanbul.

228
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,293
Istanbul?
- Mmh.

229
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:29,797
How come Istanbul?

230
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:33,434
It worked!

231
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:36,105
What worked?

232
00:23:36,507 --> 00:23:38,498
The magic ring. Sure, I know

233
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:41,740
it sounds crazy and illogical,
but it worked.

234
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,604
So where is she now?

235
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:48,417
She flew to Turkey
this morning on vacation.

236
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:53,119
All I know is she'll be waiting under
the Bosporus bridge at 12 on Friday.

237
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:56,493
July, she is so ...

238
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,023
Where are you going, by the way?
- What?

239
00:24:01,432 --> 00:24:02,592
Where are you traveling to?

240
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,933
I'm going to Turkey, too.
- What?

241
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:13,306
To Istanbul.

242
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:24,653
It's like this:

243
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:29,517
Every summer, I stand right where
you picked me up and go on vacation.

244
00:24:29,993 --> 00:24:32,154
I go wherever the wind takes me.

245
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,123
The first person to pick me up
decides where I go.

246
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,899
You do that every summer?
- Yep.

247
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:41,429
I ve been to the craziest places.

248
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,242
Italy, Spain ...
One guy even took me to Afghanistan.

249
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,100
Just imagine that! Afghanistar!

250
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:50,570
Afghanistan?
- Yeah.

251
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:52,538
Incredible.
- Absolutely.

252
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:56,544
You have no idea where you're going
to end up. It's a bit like ...

253
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,512
buying a surprise package.

254
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:02,787
Sure.
- And this year it's Turkey! Wild!

255
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:06,492
I've never been to Turkey.
This is gonna be really nice.

256
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,022
Sure.

257
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,768
It does this sometimes.

258
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:21,902
I don't believe it.

259
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:25,373
Just a sec.

260
00:25:48,872 --> 00:25:50,863
We could stay here.

261
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,308
In Bavaria?

262
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,376
The sky is blue wherever you go.

263
00:26:01,652 --> 00:26:02,641
Hey.

264
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:05,455
Tomorrow's a new day, huh?

265
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,054
Sorry, but we don't have
two singles left.

266
00:26:10,494 --> 00:26:13,588
We only have one single room
with a single bed.

267
00:26:13,997 --> 00:26:15,555
Will that do?

268
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,364
It's only for one night.

269
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:20,259
It's no problem, is it?
- No problem.

270
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:34,616
July, you took all the blanket.
Could you give me back a piece?

271
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:36,042
Sure.

272
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:46,022
You can't get to sleep, can you?

273
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,419
Nope.

274
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,065
It's uncomfortable
and hot and ...

275
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,069
D'you know the spoon position?

276
00:26:57,174 --> 00:26:58,664
Yeah, sure.

277
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,975
I've heard it's one of the most
comfortable positions for sleeping.

278
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:06,015
Really?
- Mmh.

279
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,596
Okay, who's spooning whom?

280
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,035
You spoon me.

281
00:27:46,023 --> 00:27:48,423
It really is comfortable.

282
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:51,221
Real cosy.

283
00:28:19,056 --> 00:28:20,080
Damn it!

284
00:28:23,026 --> 00:28:26,427
We go south through Italy to Bari

285
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:30,594
and take the ferry to Greece
and then on to Turkey.

286
00:28:32,035 --> 00:28:36,529
We could also go via Austria, Yugoslavia
and Bulgaria to Turkey.

287
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,068
But there's a war in Yugoslavia.
- Oh yeah.

288
00:28:41,044 --> 00:28:43,535
Or via Austria, Hungary,
Romania and Bulgaria.

289
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:47,439
That's really roundabout.
Maybe there's a direct ferry from Bari.

290
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:51,687
I have a problem.
- What?

291
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:57,157
I'm nearly broke.
I can't afford the ferry.

292
00:28:58,328 --> 00:28:59,727
That's not my problem.

293
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,123
What d'you mean?

294
00:29:07,637 --> 00:29:10,538
What's the matter?
Don't you know where to go?

295
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,774
Sure! To Istanbul!

296
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,971
I'm going to Budapest.
C'mon, get in.

297
00:29:26,857 --> 00:29:28,484
What's up? Aren't you coming?

298
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:34,628
Okay, my name is Leo.
- Daniel. My pleasure.

299
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,057
I'm July.
- July? - Like the month.

300
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,904
July is a nice name.
- Thanks. Leo isn't bad either.

301
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:47,505
Reminds me somehow of a lion.

302
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,811
I believe that's where it comes from.

303
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:58,387
Is Leo your sign of the zodiac, too?
- I'm afraid not. I'm a Scorpio.

304
00:29:58,822 --> 00:30:01,052
I have a sting in my tail.

305
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:04,991
But you're a Leo, huh?
- Yep.

306
00:30:06,963 --> 00:30:08,863
A July Leo?
- Sure thing!

307
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:11,261
Sure thing.

308
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:15,061
What about your boyfriend?
- He is not my boyfriend.

309
00:30:20,143 --> 00:30:21,667
What's that for?

310
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:25,377
That's Che.
- Yeah, but what does it mean to you?

311
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:27,813
What did Che fight for?

312
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:31,982
For justice.
- Yes, but what else?

313
00:30:33,723 --> 00:30:37,955
For freedom?
- Bingo. This Che stands for

314
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:41,796
my belief in individual freedom.
- So we got something in common.

315
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:57,304
What's up?
- I'll wait outside.

316
00:30:57,747 --> 00:30:59,612
Don't you want a beer?
- No, thanks.

317
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,420
Don't be a party pooper.
- I'm not a party pooper.

318
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:14,922
I'm going in there.
- Fine, I'll wait here.

319
00:31:21,905 --> 00:31:24,703
Hey, Leo!
- Hey, guys.

320
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,882
Okay, this is July. Okay?
- Cheers, July.

321
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:39,221
Two large beers. You want a large?
- Sure, I might as well do it right.

322
00:31:41,124 --> 00:31:45,993
Hey, were you serious about your belief
in individual freedom?

323
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:48,861
That we have it in common?
- Sure, I was serious.

324
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:50,994
Really?
- Yeah!

325
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:53,164
Wanna go with me?

326
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:54,928
What?

327
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,237
I mean, do you wanna come along?

328
00:31:58,308 --> 00:31:59,570
Where to?

329
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,008
To the end of the world maybe?

330
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:12,445
I can't.

331
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:24,833
You think he's the right guy?

332
00:32:27,337 --> 00:32:28,395
Yes.

333
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,871
Would he fight for you?

334
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:40,843
I wish he would.

335
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,384
Let's dance.

336
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:27,589
Dance?

337
00:33:31,601 --> 00:33:32,625
Okay.

338
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:00,994
Leo, stop that!

339
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:04,594
What're you doing? Stop it, Leo!

340
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:07,502
Leo!
- Leo! - Cut it out!

341
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:08,928
Shut up, Paul!

342
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,333
Leave her alone!

343
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:14,403
Stay outta this!
- Stop it, or you're leaving!

344
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,244
Shut up and sit down!
- Let me down!

345
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:21,173
Let her down!
- Daniel!

346
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,615
Hey, Daniel!

347
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:29,489
Let her go, please!

348
00:34:29,926 --> 00:34:32,190
I didn't hear you
- I said, let her go, please!

349
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:34,153
I can't hear you.
- Let her go!

350
00:34:34,597 --> 00:34:35,996
Let her go!

351
00:34:52,248 --> 00:34:54,273
Hey, c'mon! Let's go!

352
00:34:57,754 --> 00:35:01,952
My goodness, I just got in a fight.
I never fight.

353
00:35:02,592 --> 00:35:04,150
I've lost my glasses.

354
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,756
I'm a pacifist.

355
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:08,630
I detest violence.

356
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,657
What's so funny about that?

357
00:35:11,101 --> 00:35:14,002
Nothing.
- So how are we gonna get outta here?

358
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,462
By boat.
- By boat, huh?

359
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,305
Yes, by boat.

360
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:22,109
The Danube flows into the Black Sea,
doesn't it?

361
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:25,946
Right.
And Istanbul is on the Black Sea.

362
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:32,816
That's a narcotic, isn't it?
- C'mon, this isn't a narcotic.

363
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,356
It's peace.
- What d'you mean? It's illegal.

364
00:35:39,396 --> 00:35:41,557
That's a long story.

365
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:46,029
Maybe. But that stuff makes you stupid.

366
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:50,864
Do you think I'm stupid?
- No, I don't, but ...

367
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:01,746
It's cool, man.

368
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:13,192
Trust me.

369
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,800
I just inhale like with a cigarette?

370
00:36:47,697 --> 00:36:49,221
It tastes good.

371
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,477
It really tastes good.

372
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,571
Like rope.

373
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:41,013
Like singed rope.
That's sort of how it tastes.

374
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,488
It feels so warm ... here.

375
00:38:15,818 --> 00:38:17,786
Okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

376
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:21,317
You got some ash.
- Ash, ash, ash.

377
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:39,168
Want another puff?

378
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:43,444
Getting a taste for it, huh?
- Mmh.

379
00:38:47,984 --> 00:38:49,975
I once saw these guys ...

380
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,321
Students of mine at school ...

381
00:38:53,723 --> 00:38:58,160
They hold it somehow ...
Like this, I think. - Mmh.

382
00:38:58,595 --> 00:39:00,358
At school?
- At school.

383
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:03,265
Fifteen. - Incredible.
- They're all stupid.

384
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:14,736
Anything they can do, I can do better.

385
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,104
Cool.

386
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,444
What're you laughing about?

387
00:39:22,885 --> 00:39:25,376
Nothing. It's just so cute
the way you say ''cool.''

388
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,484
Oh man,
my students are always saying it.

389
00:39:30,426 --> 00:39:32,758
I was wondering
what kind of music teachers listen to.

390
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:35,221
You mean, what do I listen to?

391
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,733
Jazz.
- Jazz?

392
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:45,934
Yes, that's exactly what I thought.

393
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,809
Why? What do you listen to?

394
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:53,649
I really like old stuff:
oldies, Elvis Presley.

395
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:57,709
What about you? Oo you like oldies?

396
00:39:58,454 --> 00:40:01,423
Sometimes. I have to, because ...

397
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:04,783
every Sunday I have breakfast
at my mom's place, and ...

398
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:06,718
she listens to oldies all day.

399
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:11,795
Oldies with coffee, oldies with cereal,
oldies with peanut butter,

400
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,864
oldies with everything, for example ...

401
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,105
Know that one? ... Nice, isn't it?

402
00:40:54,043 --> 00:40:56,841
What are you going to do
when you see her?

403
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:02,046
What d'you mean?

404
00:41:03,853 --> 00:41:06,754
Like, what are you going to say to her?

405
00:41:13,463 --> 00:41:14,657
No idea.

406
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:18,356
You don't know?

407
00:41:29,245 --> 00:41:31,236
What should I say to her?

408
00:41:33,716 --> 00:41:35,581
Well, something like ...

409
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:40,288
My darling,

410
00:41:41,657 --> 00:41:47,562
I've traveled thousands of miles,
crossed rivers and moved mountains.

411
00:41:47,997 --> 00:41:51,023
I've suffered and endured agonies.

412
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:56,629
I've resisted temptation,
and I've followed the sun,

12:23 AM 5/19/201512:23 AM 5/19/2015413
00:41:57,006 --> 00:42:00,737
so I could stand before you
and tell you

414
00:42:01,177 --> 00:42:02,701
I love you.

415
00:42:12,054 --> 00:42:13,715
Isn't that too mushy?

416
00:42:35,044 --> 00:42:36,238
July?

417
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:42,544
I'll get us something to eat, okay?

418
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:46,618
I'll be right back.

419
00:43:21,324 --> 00:43:23,451
Not so loud, dear.

420
00:43:23,926 --> 00:43:27,521
Please, don't! Please!

421
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:33,468
You bums!

422
00:44:17,546 --> 00:44:18,843
Budapest?

423
00:44:35,598 --> 00:44:36,656
Do you speak German?

424
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:01,885
I'm Daniel. That's my name.

425
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:08,122
Luna.
- Luna.

426
00:45:12,735 --> 00:45:14,202
Do you smoke?

427
00:45:15,237 --> 00:45:16,261
Thanks.

428
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,806
A snack.

429
00:47:08,717 --> 00:47:11,049
Do you speak German?
- No.

430
00:47:16,826 --> 00:47:20,728
It's a simple principle.
We have one dish. Eat it or not.

431
00:47:21,163 --> 00:47:22,790
I'll definitely eat!

432
00:47:26,836 --> 00:47:28,827
Fish sticks.

433
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,441
Oh, thanks.

434
00:48:28,297 --> 00:48:30,629
I have to follow someone.

435
00:48:31,066 --> 00:48:33,933
There's a girl.
- Another coke?

436
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:35,968
Please.

437
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,871
You do speak German.

438
00:55:40,395 --> 00:55:42,363
So we meet again. Where's my money?

439
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,062
What's he doing?
- Where are my things?

440
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,900
You understand.
- Who's that?

441
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,167
I don't know.
- Give me my passport!

442
00:55:49,605 --> 00:55:51,129
The ring!
- Stay outta this!

443
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:57,941
Give me back my ring!

444
00:56:43,158 --> 00:56:45,649
I'm gonna get you bums!

445
00:56:48,897 --> 00:56:50,956
Now I'm gonna get you!

446
00:56:53,735 --> 00:56:56,363
Fuck! Why doesn't this fucker work?

447
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,434
Hey! Give me a push!

448
00:57:07,082 --> 00:57:09,050
Oh my God! Oh, my God!

449
00:57:31,339 --> 00:57:32,863
You're nuts!

450
00:57:37,012 --> 00:57:38,240
To the right!

451
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,853
Fuck!

452
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,463
I don't believe it. She's crazy.

453
00:58:00,902 --> 00:58:02,699
I'll smash your face in!

454
00:58:06,007 --> 00:58:07,338
I'm gonna get you!

455
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,805
Just wait, you bastard!

456
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,947
Wait till I get you!

457
00:58:13,682 --> 00:58:16,651
I don't understand. What?

458
00:58:17,552 --> 00:58:20,020
What's wrong? I don't understand.

459
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,149
Fuck it!

460
00:58:30,866 --> 00:58:32,493
You fucking bastards!

461
00:58:53,555 --> 00:58:54,453
Get out!

462
00:58:55,123 --> 00:58:56,954
Hands up!

463
01:00:58,413 --> 01:01:00,973
Shit.
- Yeah, that's it.

464
01:01:31,212 --> 01:01:32,076
Daniel!

465
01:01:33,848 --> 01:01:34,974
July?

466
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,918
Stop!

467
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:53,827
July, I got a big problem.
I got no passport, nothing.

468
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:56,863
And I gotta cross this border
- Where's your passport?

469
01:01:57,305 --> 01:01:59,000
It doesn't matter. Tell him anyth ng.

470
01:01:59,441 --> 01:02:00,772
Tell him that ...

471
01:02:02,744 --> 01:02:04,939
Tell him we're married, okay?

472
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:11,247
But we aren't married!
- July, please!

473
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,985
No, we can't lie to that man.
- Please!

474
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:21,962
Okay, Daniel Bannier,
will you take me as your wife?

475
01:02:22,397 --> 01:02:24,661
What?
- Will you or won't you?

476
01:02:26,234 --> 01:02:27,462
Yes, I will. Damn it!

477
01:02:27,902 --> 01:02:29,369
Now ask me.

478
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:39,837
July will you take me as your husband?

479
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,909
Yes, I will.
- Okay.

480
01:02:47,088 --> 01:02:48,055
What else?

481
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:49,957
Now the speech.
- What speech?

482
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:53,361
The one I taught you.
The Sermon on the Mount. - Why now?

483
01:02:53,795 --> 01:02:55,023
It's part of the ceremony.

484
01:02:56,931 --> 01:02:58,023
Okay ...

485
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,829
My darling ...

486
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,170
That's right, isn't it?

487
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:06,199
I've crossed over bridges ...

488
01:03:06,641 --> 01:03:07,869
Wrong, huh?

489
01:03:08,276 --> 01:03:10,107
I-I-I've crossed ...

490
01:03:10,545 --> 01:03:12,775
You haven't learned it.
- I haven't, but I will!

491
01:03:14,015 --> 01:03:15,073
Oo you promise?

492
01:03:16,518 --> 01:03:17,883
I promise.

493
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:20,945
Okay.

494
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:40,565
Hey, buddy!

495
01:04:23,084 --> 01:04:24,415
How do we get outta here?

496
01:04:24,853 --> 01:04:27,651
We could spend our honeymDon here.

497
01:04:33,795 --> 01:04:36,389
I think I have a better idea.
- What?

498
01:04:38,466 --> 01:04:40,263
We'll steal a car.

499
01:04:41,035 --> 01:04:43,128
What?
- Yeah, we'll steal a car.

500
01:04:43,538 --> 01:04:45,199
We can't steal a car!
- Why not?

501
01:04:45,607 --> 01:04:48,599
We're the good guys.
The good guys don't steal cars.

502
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,614
But we could steal a bad guy's car.

503
01:05:00,321 --> 01:05:03,552
Him? Is he a bad guy?
- Nope.

504
01:05:03,992 --> 01:05:06,984
What d'you mean?
- He's a nice guy. - Sure!

505
01:05:07,395 --> 01:05:11,991
But those are just the kind of people
who beat their wives and kids.

506
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,632
I don't know. - Those guys!
- He reminds me of a friend of mine.

507
01:05:16,671 --> 01:05:17,865
That guy.

508
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:22,573
A mass murderer! A mass murderer!
- Just look at him.

509
01:05:22,977 --> 01:05:26,413
It scares me to look at him.
- He looks real cuddly.

510
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:30,884
They all look like bad guys to me here.

511
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:50,496
You know what you're doing, don't you?

512
01:05:52,507 --> 01:05:53,940
You got it?

513
01:05:54,642 --> 01:05:59,477
What're you doing?
- It was here. - Hurry up, damn it!

514
01:06:00,715 --> 01:06:03,616
Hey! Are you crazy?
You're gonna break everything!

515
01:06:04,018 --> 01:06:06,612
Trust me, okay?
- Okay, okay ...

516
01:06:08,022 --> 01:06:11,082
Ouch! - Did you hurt yourself?
- No, I'm okay.

517
01:06:14,562 --> 01:06:15,790
Oh, damn it!

518
01:06:17,198 --> 01:06:19,132
Don't move. I think someone's looking.

519
01:06:19,534 --> 01:06:21,729
Dh shit! He's looking this way ...

520
01:06:22,337 --> 01:06:23,497
Keep cool.

521
01:06:27,709 --> 01:06:30,337
Isn't this romantic?
- What?

522
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:33,474
I never stole a car with anyone before.

523
01:06:34,182 --> 01:06:39,085
July, do me a favor and start this car,
so we can get outta here! Please!

524
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,511
Okay.

525
01:06:44,926 --> 01:06:46,359
Well? What did I tell you?

526
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:50,230
Unbelievable! - Give me five!
- You're the best!

527
01:06:52,667 --> 01:06:54,191
Tell me, Alin.

528
01:06:54,602 --> 01:06:57,298
Don't you have a blue Oacia?

529
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,071
Right.

530
01:07:01,442 --> 01:07:04,309
I think it's being stolen.

531
01:07:05,413 --> 01:07:06,345
Bullshit!

532
01:07:07,181 --> 01:07:09,615
Oh shit! They're stealing my car!

533
01:08:59,193 --> 01:08:59,994
No passport, no Bulgaria.

534
01:08:59,994 --> 01:09:01,154
No passport, no Bulgaria.

535
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:05,498
I'm fed up. If the Bulgarians mess
around like that, what'll the Turks do?

536
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,561
The Turks are probably five times
worse than the Bulgarians.

537
01:09:09,003 --> 01:09:12,166
Hey, wait a moment.
Could you back up a bit?

538
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:25,214
Where does that lead to?
- We'll soon see.

539
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,531
Look at that.
- Mmh. It looks dead.

540
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,027
That's not what I meant.
- What do you mean?

541
01:09:44,005 --> 01:09:46,132
That must be Bulgaria.
- Bullshit.

542
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:49,510
Why bullshit?
- This puddle isn't the Oanube.

543
01:09:49,944 --> 01:09:54,244
Sorry, but the Danube isn't the border.
- Yes, it is! - Are you certain?

544
01:09:56,017 --> 01:09:59,544
No.
- Then this could be the border.

545
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:02,649
Okay, let's assume this is the border.
So what?

546
01:10:03,524 --> 01:10:05,014
I'll just drive over.

547
01:10:07,195 --> 01:10:09,891
How do you mean that?
- I'll get a running start,

548
01:10:10,298 --> 01:10:14,735
hit the ramp and bingo!
I'll jump the river. - You're nuts!

549
01:10:15,136 --> 01:10:17,161
We need the car!
- We can do without it!

550
01:10:17,605 --> 01:10:21,735
It's Wednesday. This is still Romania. I
need the car to get to Turkey by Friday!

551
01:10:22,143 --> 01:10:24,839
But you won't make it, if you die!
Have you thought of that?

552
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,645
Sensible teachers
don't do things like that!

553
01:10:31,385 --> 01:10:32,409
Okay ...

554
01:10:33,387 --> 01:10:36,117
The car is my weight ''x,'' okay?

555
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:42,261
''X'' weighs about half a ton.
The distance is about 25 meters.

556
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:46,030
The question is:
How fast do I have to go

557
01:10:46,467 --> 01:10:50,528
up a ramp with a 10-degree angle
to cross 25 meters , right?

558
01:10:51,772 --> 01:10:54,502
Right. Okay. The answer is:

559
01:10:57,979 --> 01:11:02,109
96.41 kilometers per hour.

560
01:11:54,168 --> 01:11:55,294
Oamn it!

561
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:02,543
Great! Congratulations!
I really feel sorry for your students.

562
01:12:02,543 --> 01:12:06,035
Great! Congratulations!
I really feel sorry for your students.

563
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:09,814
You could have been killed!
- What if I had been killed?

564
01:12:10,251 --> 01:12:12,344
That's nothing to joke about.
- Why not?

565
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:15,051
Because I don't like it.

566
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:17,920
What would you have done
if I'd been killed?

567
01:12:18,326 --> 01:12:20,886
I'd be happy
to finally get rid of you.

568
01:12:38,012 --> 01:12:39,570
What's that?

569
01:12:40,014 --> 01:12:41,242
The border.

570
01:12:44,085 --> 01:12:45,347
The Danube.

571
01:12:47,188 --> 01:12:48,678
What's so funny?

572
01:12:49,357 --> 01:12:50,654
It's real funny, huh?

573
01:12:51,459 --> 01:12:52,858
Real funny.

574
01:12:54,195 --> 01:12:55,958
Terribly funny.

575
01:12:56,397 --> 01:12:58,729
Calm down.
- No! It's all your fault!

576
01:12:59,533 --> 01:13:00,932
My fault?
- Your fault!

577
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:05,499
Why is it my fault?
- Because all this shit is your fault!

578
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,567
f I'd taken the ferry from Bari

579
01:13:07,975 --> 01:13:11,741
I'd be in Istanbul now
instead of in a pit like this!

580
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:15,910
Bari!
Without me you'd never get to Bari!

581
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,817
You'd still be in Bavaria!

582
01:13:18,252 --> 01:13:21,847
Who helped you cross the border?
Who stole the car?

583
01:13:22,289 --> 01:13:25,122
And who sold me this stupid ring?

584
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:29,257
If I hadn't bought this crap,
I'd still be in Hamburg ...

585
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,858
reading on my balcony!
And I wouldn't be here!

586
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:34,894
Then go back home to the Elbe!

587
01:13:35,336 --> 01:13:39,602
Read a newspaper or a book!
Just go back to your old dull life!

588
01:13:46,514 --> 01:13:48,675
You just don't want me to meet her.

589
01:14:38,733 --> 01:14:42,225
The first person to stop
decides where I go.

590
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:07,192
He didn't count.

591
01:16:12,326 --> 01:16:13,918
That was it?

592
01:16:15,729 --> 01:16:16,661
That was it.

593
01:16:17,097 --> 01:16:21,727
Just a second.
You experienced all that?

594
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:24,560
I experienced all that.

595
01:16:25,005 --> 01:16:29,704
You didn't make up that crap?
- Why should I tell you a bunch of crap?

596
01:16:30,144 --> 01:16:32,237
Respect, kiddo.

597
01:16:32,646 --> 01:16:33,738
Thanks.

598
01:16:36,283 --> 01:16:41,186
Hey ... where's that awful sme I
been coming from the whole time?

599
01:16:41,922 --> 01:16:44,288
Hey, kiddo. You don't have
your papers anymore, do you?

600
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,155
No ...
- Get out!

601
01:16:48,596 --> 01:16:52,896
What? - Get out! - What the hell?
- Get out! - I'm not getting out!

602
01:16:53,334 --> 01:16:55,928
Get the fuck out of the car!
- What the hell?

603
01:16:58,639 --> 01:17:00,971
Are you blind? Why don't you drive up?

604
01:17:02,009 --> 01:17:04,034
Get out! Both of you!

605
01:17:08,315 --> 01:17:09,782
He should get out, too.

606
01:17:10,217 --> 01:17:12,014
Get out.

607
01:17:12,453 --> 01:17:14,114
What?
- I told him to get out.

608
01:17:14,555 --> 01:17:17,353
I already said that.
- He's German.

609
01:17:18,325 --> 01:17:19,792
German! German!

610
01:17:20,227 --> 01:17:22,354
Your passports and car registration.

611
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:30,161
Passport!
- I don't have a passport.

612
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:32,769
His passport was stolen.

613
01:17:33,173 --> 01:17:34,606
Tell that to your grandma.

614
01:17:35,009 --> 01:17:36,909
What's the problem?
- Shut up!

615
01:17:38,512 --> 01:17:39,342
What?

616
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,775
I told him to shut up.
- Shut up!

617
01:17:42,216 --> 01:17:44,707
I didn't say a thing.
- Shut up! - Okay.

618
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:46,547
You're going nowhere without a passport.

619
01:17:46,987 --> 01:17:48,750
His passport really was stolen.

620
01:17:49,189 --> 01:17:51,521
What are you? Terrorists,

621
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:53,620
Satanists or what?

622
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:56,087
Open the trunk.
- Isa, what ...

623
01:17:56,497 --> 01:17:57,828
Open it!

624
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:11,274
Arrest them at once!

625
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:16,981
This is unbelievable. Unbelievab e.

626
01:18:17,351 --> 01:18:21,253
Now it's all over with!
Forever! And why?

627
01:18:21,689 --> 01:18:25,318
Because the guy who picked me up
has a corpse in the trunk. Just imagine!

628
01:18:25,759 --> 01:18:27,886
A corpse! Is that your hobby?
- Shut up!

629
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:31,264
I'm not gonna shut up, okay?
- Don't work me up!

630
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:35,761
Will your pants burst or what?
- Listen here, you prick!

631
01:18:36,203 --> 01:18:39,764
I don't wanna hear more than 20 words
from you till we get to Istanbul! Okay?

632
01:18:40,207 --> 01:18:42,641
Okay, you can have 'em right away:
AsshoIe! Asshole! Asshole ...!

633
01:18:56,623 --> 01:18:59,387
The corpse in the trunk
is my Uncle Ahmed.

634
01:18:59,793 --> 01:19:00,782
What?

635
01:19:01,729 --> 01:19:04,459
He came to visit us
from Istanbul.

636
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:08,031
Uncle Ahmed is my dad's oldest brother.

637
01:19:08,402 --> 01:19:11,462
And my dad kept inviting him
to come to Germany.

638
01:19:11,905 --> 01:19:13,736
Five months ago he finally came.

639
01:19:14,141 --> 01:19:17,633
He got himself a visa for three months
and hustled up to Germany.

640
01:19:20,614 --> 01:19:22,639
He thought Berlin was really cool.

641
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:25,213
Loads of Turks on our block.

642
01:19:25,586 --> 01:19:29,955
All at once, he was part of the soene
and really enjoying himself.

643
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:33,716
And we, my family and me,

644
01:19:34,094 --> 01:19:36,756
we were enjoying it, too.

645
01:19:36,997 --> 01:19:41,366
My nephews ... I have two nephews,
my sister's kids.

646
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:45,531
They stopped going to kindergarten,

647
01:19:45,973 --> 01:19:49,374
'cause when nobody else was there,
Uncle Ahmed took care of the kids.

648
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:53,041
You wouldn't believe what a good cook
he was, Daniel!

649
01:19:55,549 --> 01:19:57,517
Better than my mother.

650
01:20:00,821 --> 01:20:05,190
The three months went by,
and Uncle Ahmed stayed.

651
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,227
And then the inevitable happened.

652
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:15,265
He died.

653
01:20:15,736 --> 01:20:20,139
Without so much as a goodbye.
A heart attack. Oead.

654
01:20:21,575 --> 01:20:22,439
Really dumb.

655
01:20:24,311 --> 01:20:27,678
The whole family got together
and had an emergency meeting.

656
01:20:28,549 --> 01:20:30,073
We couldn't go the official route,

657
01:20:30,517 --> 01:20:33,953
'cause my parents had an illegal corpse
in their basement.

658
01:20:34,421 --> 01:20:38,289
So we decided to smuggle his corpse
to Turkey.

659
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:41,794
And since I'm the youngest,

660
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:43,821
and I'm on vacation,

661
01:20:44,231 --> 01:20:46,426
I got stuck with all this crap.

662
01:20:47,501 --> 01:20:48,559
Shit.

663
01:20:49,002 --> 01:20:51,129
They're gonna ask for a certificate.

664
01:20:51,572 --> 01:20:53,403
You can have it faxed.

665
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:55,399
No, they'll want the original.

666
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:57,003
Shit

667
01:20:57,444 --> 01:21:00,174
If I could just make one phone call.

668
01:21:01,081 --> 01:21:02,810
I'd call up my sweetheart.

669
01:21:03,417 --> 01:21:06,079
She'd bring me the birth certificate.

670
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:11,715
Isa, I'm running out of time.

671
01:21:16,697 --> 01:21:17,425
Come on.

672
01:21:19,032 --> 01:21:20,522
Wait a sec! What about me?

673
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:33,041
Hey there, who was that?

674
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:37,007
We'll soon see. Come on.

675
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:44,752
The door's open.

676
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:21,217
So you came all this way

677
01:22:21,662 --> 01:22:24,096
to take your dead uncle to Turkey?

678
01:22:33,774 --> 01:22:35,571
Bravo, Isa! Bravo!

679
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,311
Osman, get the hero some tea.

680
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:52,759
Cigarette?

681
01:22:54,228 --> 01:22:55,217
Thanks.

682
01:23:01,068 --> 01:23:03,036
I need your uncle's birth certificate.

683
01:23:04,171 --> 01:23:07,800
If I could make a phone call, I would

684
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:10,438
have it brought from Istanbul tonight.

685
01:23:10,877 --> 01:23:12,777
Show Isa where the phone is.

686
01:23:21,755 --> 01:23:23,450
To all passengers:

687
01:23:23,824 --> 01:23:27,260
We will be taking a 30-minute break.

688
01:23:28,528 --> 01:23:34,694
The tea is complimentary.

689
01:24:01,695 --> 01:24:02,753
July?

690
01:24:05,432 --> 01:24:07,366
Hey! How come you're here?

691
01:24:07,768 --> 01:24:08,962
What're you doing here?

692
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:10,470
Melek.

693
01:24:11,705 --> 01:24:12,899
This is incredible.

694
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:16,737
I'm on my way to Istanbul.

695
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:18,804
What are you going there for?

696
01:24:22,616 --> 01:24:25,744
That's ... that's quite a long story.

697
01:24:26,153 --> 01:24:28,781
Tell me. But be quick.

698
01:24:38,765 --> 01:24:40,255
I met a girl.

699
01:24:43,937 --> 01:24:45,302
I fell in love with her.

700
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:53,001
And I'm going to Istanbul
to meet her there.

701
01:24:57,184 --> 01:25:00,176
Where are you going to meet her
in Istanbul?

702
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:05,982
Under the bridge.

703
01:25:10,931 --> 01:25:13,525
Are you sure she'll be there?

704
01:25:20,874 --> 01:25:22,136
I hope so.

705
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:26,576
The bus for Edirne is now boarding.

706
01:25:27,013 --> 01:25:29,174
Please, take your seats.

707
01:25:30,016 --> 01:25:31,347
I have to go.

708
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:37,386
Aren't you going to Istanbul? - No.
I must take something to the border.

709
01:25:39,659 --> 01:25:40,626
What?

710
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:44,595
That's also a long story.

711
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:05,513
Give my regards to your boyfriend!

712
01:26:05,919 --> 01:26:07,318
I will.

713
01:26:11,358 --> 01:26:13,189
Did I tell you about him?

714
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:16,158
Don't miss your bus.

715
01:28:13,113 --> 01:28:14,102
Hi!

716
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,615
You made it.

717
01:28:21,288 --> 01:28:22,949
Nice to see you.

718
01:28:29,529 --> 01:28:31,258
Where's your date?

719
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:38,965
My darling,

720
01:28:40,206 --> 01:28:42,174
I've traveled thousands of miles,

721
01:28:43,677 --> 01:28:45,406
crossed rivers

722
01:28:46,513 --> 01:28:48,310
and moved mountains.

723
01:28:49,149 --> 01:28:53,381
I've suffered
and endured agonies.

724
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,419
I've resisted temptation,

725
01:28:57,824 --> 01:29:02,056
and I've followed the sun,
so I could stand before you

726
01:29:03,029 --> 01:29:04,291
and tell you

727
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:07,497
I love you.

728
01:29:40,467 --> 01:29:41,900
Okay, we'll play the old game:

729
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:44,735
The first person to stop
decides where we go, okay?

730
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:47,105
Want me to tell you something?

731
01:29:47,607 --> 01:29:49,802
I love you.
- What?

732
01:29:50,243 --> 01:29:51,574
I love you.

733
01:29:52,379 --> 01:29:56,372
It's funny, but I'm not sure
I heard that right ... - I love you.

734
01:29:56,783 --> 01:30:00,275
I just said that it's difficult
to understand you!

735
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:04,417
I love you!
- That's how it has to sound.

736
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:09,722
Hey, you two lovebirds!
Where to?

737
01:30:12,332 --> 01:30:13,959
To the fucking south!

738
01:30:14,534 --> 01:30:16,024
Okay, get in!

739
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,717
What are you waiting for?
