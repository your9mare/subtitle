A film by
Caroline Link

00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:07,336
BEYOND SI LENCE

3
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:12,051
Come on!

4
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,218
Great!

5
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:45,768
Did you hurt yourself?

6
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:32,925
It is thundering outside, Daddy.

7
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:37,089
It's so loud.
It goes BANG! BOOM! BAM!

8
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:40,599
It's like all hell's been let loose.

9
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:55,814
<i>Yes, that must have been very loud.</i>

10
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:57,873
<i>I can just imagine it.</i>

11
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:00,886
No, Daddy.
That wasn't loud.

12
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:04,754
Lightning is silent
like the moon.

13
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:07,258
It's just the thunder
that's noisy.

14
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,795
It's terribly loud.

15
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:12,889
<i>Ahh, thunder?</i>

16
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:17,801
<i>What would we do</i>
<i>without you and your ears?</i>

17
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:26,543
Daddy, you sound like a fish
blubbering through the water.

18
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,906
You're slurping.

19
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:32,651
The telephone is ringing.

20
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,384
Good morning.
Lara Bischoff speaking.

21
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:41,256
Hello, Grandma.

22
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,889
It's Grandma.
Her roses are wilting.

23
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,001
Mommy says your apartment is too warm.
You should put aspo--

24
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:57,875
aspirin into the water.

25
00:04:57,944 --> 00:05:01,607
Are we coming for Christmas?

26
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,478
Sure, we are.

27
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:16,061
Grandma wants to talk to you.

28
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,154
I think he's already left.

29
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,597
I have to go to school.

30
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,430
Mommy, come here.

31
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,966
Okay, Grandma. Bye.

32
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:39,611
- ''Hello. How are you?''
- ''Fine, thanks.''

33
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,332
- Good morning, Santa Claus.
- Good morning.

34
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,082
Daddy...

35
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:23,220
you wanted to enlarge
the poster for the school celebration.

36
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:32,200
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Lara.

37
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:47,713
- I'm on my way.
- Lara! How are you?

38
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:49,846
- Fine.
- Does Martin know...

39
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:52,187
we don't get any
Christmas money this year?

40
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:54,920
- Is that bad?
- Well-- Will you tell him?

41
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:58,794
If it's bad, tell him yourself.
I have to go to school.

42
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,594
Bye.

43
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:04,865
''Here, he thought...

44
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:07,736
is where...

45
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:11,937
Schatzhauser...

46
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:13,239
lives.

47
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,649
He took off--''

48
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:21,278
Lara, that was your homework.
Didn't you practice reading?

49
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:25,957
Didn't you have time?

50
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:29,654
Maybe she read it to her dad
and he thought it was great.

51
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:34,729
There's no getting
around it, Lara.

52
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:36,735
Reading is important.

53
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:41,663
If you don't work at home,
you'll have to stay after school.

54
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:43,504
Do you understand?

55
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:48,806
Continue reading, Uli,
but with feeling.

56
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:50,509
With feeling?

57
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:57,151
''And when he said that,
he was surprised to see...''

58
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:17,375
<i>How much longer will that take?</i>

59
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:20,435
<i>We have an appointment at the bank.!</i>

60
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:25,109
Not now! We have reading now.
That's important.

61
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:28,951
<i>Yes, learn to read proper.</i>

62
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:32,116
<i>I'm very proud of you.</i>

63
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:40,996
What's wrong now, Mommy?

64
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:45,128
- <i>I'll wait.</i>
- What's wrong?

65
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:48,039
Bea, what's so funny?

66
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:50,371
Lara's mother is outside.

67
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:52,536
What? Again?

68
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:54,443
This is the last time.

69
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:58,177
Next time, keep your waiting
out on the green.

70
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,326
''Life is the best teacher,
not school.''

71
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:13,092
Great!Just tell that
to my teacher.

72
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,294
No, sorry.
I can't do anything till March 1 .

73
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,700
They committed themselves
for half a year.

74
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:21,899
The return isn't payable till then.

75
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:25,809
<i>Ask about the money</i>
<i>we paid into the account.</i>

76
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:30,043
<i>Can't he give us back any of it?</i>
<i>We need money now.!</i>

77
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:32,744
<i>He can't, Daddy.</i>
<i>Stop begging.!</i>

78
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:34,684
<i>Ask him.!</i>

79
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:38,019
My father says thank you.
He's satisfied with your business.

80
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:40,616
I'm pleased.

81
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,992
- <i>He says no.</i>
- <i>You didn't ask.!</i>

82
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:46,759
- Can I help your parents?
- No, thank you.

83
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:53,396
Right. If I say
it won't work, it won't.

84
00:09:53,473 --> 00:09:55,407
- Shall we go?
- Thank you, Lara.

85
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:58,273
My parents are your customers,
not me.

86
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:01,104
<i>Translate what I tell you.!</i>

87
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,774
- I did!
- Would you like some candy?

88
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:21,292
No, I don't hear anything yet.

89
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,994
''He was...

90
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:26,334
surprised...

91
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:29,739
to see--''

92
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:39,007
Yes, Daddy.
Now I can hear it.

93
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:42,077
It's nice music, Daddy.
Leave it on.

94
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:47,682
Okay, I'll keep on reading.

95
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:55,857
''Behind the thick pine...''

96
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:21,957
Yoo-hoo! Grandma! Grandpa!

97
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,668
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

98
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:45,243
<i>I don't remember how she looks...</i>

99
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:48,879
but she smells like
lilies of the valley and summer.

100
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:51,150
- Who?
- Clarissa.

101
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:55,888
When are they going to be here?
Robert is probably about to explode.

102
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:04,101
I really envy you.

103
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,367
You speak that magic tongue
as if it were a game.

104
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,037
If I hadn't listened to that pighead,
my hands might be able to fly too.

105
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,705
Will you help me set the table?

106
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,514
Hello, Clarissa and Gregor.

107
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:24,647
Hi, dear. Merry Christmas, you two.
How nice you're here.

108
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:28,285
I only came for the goose.
We're having roast goose, aren't we?

109
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:31,819
These belong in the living room.

110
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:34,264
I thought they belonged
in the attic.

111
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:38,861
-How has it been so far?
-Peaceful, and I hope it stays that way.

112
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:41,372
- Sure. It's Christmas.
- Exactly.

113
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,568
Why are you so late?

114
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:49,742
- Merry Christmas, Dad.
- Merry Christmas.

115
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:51,215
Martin.

116
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,588
It's freezing outside!

117
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:05,158
And I forgot my blanket in heaven.

118
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,460
What do I see?

119
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:12,800
Nothing but old people!

120
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,108
Aren't there any--

121
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:20,111
What do you call those little--

122
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,841
Children!
Aren't there any in here?

123
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:24,439
You naughty girl!

124
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:27,918
I know who you are.
You aren't Santa Claus.

125
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:30,820
If you say that,
you won't get any presents.

126
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:33,153
Who am I?

127
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:36,627
Uncle Gregor--
No! Santa Claus!

128
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,456
You good little girl.

129
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:43,627
All of these things are...

130
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:46,665
for you!

131
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:48,764
Does it taste good?

132
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:51,401
I didn't know what to buy.

133
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:57,314
Take it.
I know that you can use it.

134
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:02,015
- Who gave you that nice book?
- Daddy.

135
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:05,319
- Lara, come here.
- Okay, Grandma.

136
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:11,129
-We'll read it later.
-Shall we play the piece from last year?

137
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:16,092
- What should I do?
- You can collect the napkins.

138
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:00,745
<i>I thought we'd read the book.</i>

139
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:03,577
Wait till Clarissa
is finished playing.

140
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:05,947
<i>Use your hands</i>
<i>when you talk to me.!</i>

141
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:00,832
Wonderful, you two.

142
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:09,570
Do you talk to the baby?

143
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:12,447
Sounds are very important
for babies.

144
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:15,180
- Is that right, Grandma?
- That's right.

145
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:17,586
Don't you want
to spend the night here?

146
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:19,352
Oh, yes! Please!

147
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,553
You'd need at least an hour
to drive home in this weather.

148
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,661
Don't cheat.

149
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:34,837
Here, this is for you.

150
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:36,499
What is it?

151
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:45,011
My first one.
I learned to play on it.

152
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:48,315
- Do you want it?
- Thank you, Clarissa.

153
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:53,324
Look. You press your lower lip
against your teeth.

154
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,797
Hey, you're talented.

155
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,607
Lara! Where are you?

156
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,941
- I have to go.
- Stay a while.

157
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:18,443
- I'll drive you home tomorrow.
- Oh, yes.

158
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:22,787
Ask her.

159
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:28,357
Clarissa wants me
to stay a while. May I?

160
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:31,453
She'll drive me home tomorrow.

161
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,521
Okay?

162
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,506
Look. This is my favorite color.

163
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:17,337
Mommy never puts on makeup.

164
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:23,511
When I was your age,
my hair was this short.

165
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:27,276
- Should I cut yours?
- No.

166
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:29,514
It would be pretty.

167
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:33,490
Okay, okay!
I won't do anything you don't want.

168
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:40,189
You see...

169
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,827
that was my haircut.

170
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:45,768
- Is that Dad?
- Yes.

171
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:48,807
That's us about <i>2</i>0 years ago.
Look at Grandma.

172
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:52,833
- You didn't like him?
- Who do you mean?

173
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:54,846
Martin?

174
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:56,848
Did he say that?

175
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,146
That's wrong.

176
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:01,743
When we were young,
we were very close.

177
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:03,413
And then?

178
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:07,983
You know your father.
He can really be stubborn sometimes.

179
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,860
Your grandma always took his side.
He could do everything.

180
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:14,024
On his 1 5th birthday...

181
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:17,899
he knocked all the cups
and plates off the table.

182
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,461
And Grandma didn't even
bat an eyelid.

183
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:24,566
He was always her favorite.
I never had a chance.

184
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:26,577
But you never learned his language.

185
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:29,170
Yes, I did. A bit.

186
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:33,810
As kids, we made up
our own sign language.

187
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:36,286
But the doctors said
it was a mistake--

188
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:40,724
that sign language apparently
kept him from learning to speak.

189
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,352
You look pretty in that dress.

190
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:50,495
Well, what do you say?
Shall I cut it off?

191
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:56,267
Don't be afraid.
I'll make you look beautiful.

192
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:31,973
<i>I told you to come this afternoon.</i>

193
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:39,746
<i>What happened to you?</i>

194
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,631
<i>Why are you crying?</i>

195
00:20:56,702 --> 00:20:59,170
<i>Now you look like her.</i>

196
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,701
<i>That's what you wanted, right?</i>

197
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:10,773
<i>We're stuck together.</i>

198
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:12,612
Let me go!

199
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:17,151
Hey, Daddy! Let me go!

200
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:46,546
Mommy, why can't you ride a bike?

201
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:53,517
You have a bad sense of balance
because of your ears.

202
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:58,222
I want you to learn how.
Every real mother can ride a bike.

203
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,069
When the baby's born. Promise?

204
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,918
Hey, you in there,
don't be afraid.

205
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:26,184
Out here, life
isn't completely quiet.

206
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:31,025
When you come, I'll be here, and I'll
play a song for you on my new clarinet.

207
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:05,787
How often have I told you?
The cellos are too high.

208
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:07,798
Mr. Gartner!

209
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:12,667
Not now! We're rehearsing!
The flute players don't listen!

210
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:16,367
Frau Mertens sent me down.
I play the clarinet.

211
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:20,503
- Can you read notes?
- She can't even read any books!

212
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:24,609
Come over here.

213
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:30,511
Some things take time.
I haven't given up hope yet...

214
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:34,423
that you'll master the triangle
by the next parents' evening.

215
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:41,363
C-D-F-G.

216
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:47,937
Wonderful.
Now hold the last tone.

217
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:51,969
Great.
Now from the beginning again.

218
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:54,604
''Does Good Claus Do Fun Games.''

219
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,478
I didn't want to learn poems.

220
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,397
My homework?
I don't have any.

221
00:24:32,718 --> 00:24:37,451
I'm not wasting time.
Mrs. Mertens said I've gotten better.

222
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:40,583
What are you doing?
Give me back my clarinet!

223
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:44,925
What? Music keeps me
from learning?

224
00:24:44,997 --> 00:24:48,398
Nonsense! Learning
isn't more important!

225
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:52,028
You don't know what's important!
You're deaf!.

226
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:54,937
You don't even know
what music is!

227
00:24:57,142 --> 00:25:00,407
You're mean!
You never cared about my schoolwork.

228
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,140
Neither you nor Mommy did!

229
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:04,739
You just don't want me
to play the clarinet!

230
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:06,478
I hate you!

231
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:15,860
<i>I'm going to lose her.</i>

232
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:24,827
<i>Only if you make the same mistake</i>
<i>your parents did.</i>

233
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:28,866
<i>What do you mean?</i>

234
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:32,970
<i>Accept her for what she is.</i>

235
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:36,037
<i>She can hear,</i>
<i>and we are deaf.</i>

236
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:38,742
<i>She is my child.</i>

237
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:43,354
<i>But she doesn't belong to you.</i>

238
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,622
The baby!

239
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:48,408
It'll take that long?
I want to stay.

240
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:52,974
I'll stay here with you
till the baby comes.

241
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:08,926
Yes, they make a sound.
They sound like bells.

242
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:12,596
The more wind there is,
the louder they ring.

243
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:29,345
Were you happy too
when Clarissa was born?

244
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:33,184
At first. And then?

245
00:28:36,294 --> 00:28:39,786
Didn't you ever play together
when you were my age?

246
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:42,791
Why?

247
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:49,833
When Clarissa was nine or ten...

248
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:54,845
she gave her first concert
in front of a large audience.

249
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:59,111
Grandpa had invited
lots of important people.

250
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:04,818
I think it was
his 50th birthday.

251
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,825
Everyone was very excited
on that day.

252
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:12,057
Clarissa had to play
several pieces on the clarinet.

253
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,690
She had practiced them
for a long time.

254
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:18,224
Grandpa was very proud
of his daughter.

255
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,606
From then on, she never played again
when I was in the room...

256
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:36,613
and so I spent many evenings
alone in my room.

257
00:30:57,903 --> 00:31:01,100
I have this from a friend
who teaches at a high school.

258
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:04,631
It may be a bit difficult,
but try it.

259
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:07,610
This is your first music
with triplets.

260
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,842
When you reach this point,
count to yourself: 1 , <i>2</i>, 3--

261
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:14,081
- That fast?
- No.

262
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:17,246
As fast as you can.
Since everything is in G major--

263
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:19,256
So this is F sharp.

264
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:22,892
1 , <i>2</i>, 3.

265
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,806
Hey, Mommy! Don't!

266
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,517
Don't, Mommy!

267
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:53,090
I wanted to read her a story.
I'm supposed to talk to her a lot.

268
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:59,996
Oh, yeah?
How do you know she's tired?

269
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:02,033
Did she tell you that?

270
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:11,775
Okay.

271
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,543
Marie? Can you hear that?

272
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:46,837
Hey, you can hear!

273
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:52,575
She can hear!
Marie, you can hear!

274
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:02,957
<i>But why are you suffering?</i>

275
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:06,930
<i>No, everything is different.</i>

276
00:33:06,998 --> 00:33:08,761
<i>I'm not like I used to be.</i>

277
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,165
<i>But there's one thing</i>
<i>you have to know.</i>

278
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:14,034
<i>You love me.</i>
<i>You know you love me.</i>

279
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:15,834
<i>Yes,yes.</i>

280
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:20,241
<i>Look at me, Maria.</i>
<i>We have our whole lives ahead of us.</i>

281
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:23,311
<i>You and me.</i>

282
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:25,906
<i>Nothing can come between us.</i>

283
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:28,782
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>we'll always stay together.</i>

284
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:32,589
<i>Yes.</i>

285
00:33:45,337 --> 00:33:46,770
A bike ride?

286
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:48,931
But you don't know how, Mommy.

287
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:12,615
Except for the triangle,
everything was quite nice.

288
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,784
- I'm not so good at music.
- You don't say!

289
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,819
And if the trumpet player
would kindly remove his chewing gum--

290
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:27,628
It's nice that you've come.
Lara is a wonderful pupil, you see...

291
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:31,106
but she won't be able to pass...

292
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:35,135
unless she improves
her reading and writing.

293
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:40,145
<i>My reading is improving,</i>
<i>but it isn't perfect yet.</i>

294
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:45,788
And we can't always allow her
to leave class early.

295
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:50,556
<i>Tell her we're happy that she</i>
<i>lets you leave class early sometimes.</i>

296
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,489
Are you finished yet?

297
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:58,832
<i>It's difficult to find</i>
<i>a good translator here.</i>

298
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:03,934
It's summer vacation soon.
Then I won't have to leave early.

299
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:10,510
That's my last word on the matter!
Next time, I won't let you go.

300
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:14,279
<i>You're a wonderful teacher.</i>
<i>Lara really likes you.</i>

301
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:16,513
She says you're quite nice.

302
00:36:24,262 --> 00:36:26,457
- They're pretty. Thank you.
- At last!

303
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:29,295
I finally get to meet you!

304
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:33,804
Your daughter is extremely talented.

305
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:37,364
For the parents' evening, I've reserved
two seats for you in the first row.

306
00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:39,000
Okay?

307
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:41,739
<i>This is my music teacher.</i>

308
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:46,876
<i>He says it's a shame that you never</i>
<i>allow me to play the clarinet.</i>

309
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:53,891
We have to pick up our baby.
Any more questions?

310
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:56,722
Lara, you told them
how worried I am?

311
00:36:56,794 --> 00:37:00,286
I told them everything--
not word for word, but more or less.

312
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:07,031
The easiest note is G.
No fingers. Look!

313
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:12,038
But I never get to play it.

314
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,568
Maybe it's too simple
for them to use.

315
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:25,153
I did it on the bus.
There's more I have to read...

316
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:27,521
but I can do it tomorrow.

317
00:37:33,965 --> 00:37:35,899
Are you going tomorrow?

318
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:45,870
Of course, the baby.

319
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:17,397
''The sun resounds
in age-old fashion...

320
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:20,544
in brotherly spheres
of rival calls...

321
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:22,876
completing its appointed action...

322
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:25,973
by rendering up its thundersqualls.

323
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:30,177
The sight of it
gives angels strength...

324
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,581
though its wisdom
is never proclaimed.

325
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:36,923
These works
of baffling magnificence...

326
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:39,930
dazzle as if they'd just been made.''

327
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:05,650
It's your turn.
Is everything okay?

328
00:39:05,723 --> 00:39:09,318
You'll do a good job.
You'll play very, very well.

329
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:14,061
And now Lara Bischoff
from Class 3C.

330
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:16,930
She'll play a piece on the clarinet.

331
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:19,118
It's absolutely the best school.
Students come from all over the world.

332
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:25,326
What do you think?
It's a question of Lara's future.

333
00:41:26,564 --> 00:41:31,194
You want to take away
my only talented student?

334
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,703
That's not very funny.

335
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:36,968
She has to develop her talent,
and you can't become anything here.

336
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:42,410
- That's right.
- I'm not so sure. Berlin?

337
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,506
I'd have to rent a room.
That's too expensive.

338
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:47,608
There are other ways.

339
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:50,245
You think Dad
would take your money?

340
00:41:50,321 --> 00:41:52,448
It isn't for him,
it's for you.

341
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:56,289
- I could write a recommendation.
- Music isn't that important to me.

342
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,626
If you don't accept that offer,
you'll be missing your big chance.

343
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:03,895
You can't look after your parents
your whole life!

344
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:08,964
You show up once a year,
and every time you have a new idea.

345
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,669
- Sometimes I think you're just bored.
- Exactly.

346
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:14,506
Here's my final offer:

347
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:18,447
Spend the summer with us,
and we'll practice every day.

348
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:21,917
All summer long
we'll practice and go to concerts...

349
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:24,318
and see if you can pass
the entrance exam.

350
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:27,221
- Would you like to?
- May I come along?

351
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,225
You know I'd like to.

352
00:42:33,464 --> 00:42:37,059
You can't imagine how boring it is
all day with your uncle.

353
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:39,902
Look!

354
00:43:11,736 --> 00:43:15,365
What about Marie?
Can't she make calls for you?

355
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:22,038
Okay, I'll be right there.

356
00:43:36,761 --> 00:43:39,559
I got something to drink
with some girlfriends.

357
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:46,897
Sure, I'll bring them along sometime.
I have to make some calls for Mom.

358
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:12,460
<i>You see this beautiful night?</i>

359
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:22,002
<i>Take a good look.</i>

360
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:24,007
<i>Things change quickly.</i>

361
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,605
<i>Spring will begin soon.</i>

362
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:33,650
<i>The snow will melt.</i>

363
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:37,243
<i>How does snow sound?</i>

364
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:39,482
<i>What does it say to you?</i>

365
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:47,663
It says, ''Crunch, crunch, brr, brr.''

366
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:51,964
<i>What are ''crunch''and ''brr''?</i>
<i>What kind of words are they?</i>

367
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:56,029
To tell the truth,
snow doesn't say much.

368
00:44:56,107 --> 00:45:00,134
It's even said that snow
swallows every sound.

369
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:04,238
When snow is on the ground,
everything is much quieter.

370
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:06,010
<i>Honest?</i>

371
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:08,313
<i>Snow makes the world quiet?</i>

372
00:45:08,386 --> 00:45:10,581
<i>That's beautiful.</i>

373
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:13,214
Clarissa was at school today.

374
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,758
I didn't know she was here myself.

375
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:25,101
It's her birthday soon.
Grandpa wants to take us all to dinner.

376
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:28,969
Won't you come with us, please?
For my sake.

377
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:49,351
- Hey, you pig!
- It's only chocolate.

378
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:52,396
- Before dinner?
- Bettina treated me.

379
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:58,226
Bettina's sleeping over.
Her parents aren't home.

380
00:45:58,302 --> 00:46:01,567
- Can we use your clarinet?
- By no means!

381
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:04,403
Why not?
Afraid I'll break it?

382
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:06,443
Have you set the table yet?

383
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,240
Let me show Bettina! Please!

384
00:46:09,313 --> 00:46:11,110
Stop it! You won't get it!

385
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:13,150
If you're bored,
you can help Mom in the kitchen.

386
00:46:13,217 --> 00:46:16,084
I don't want your stupid stick!

387
00:46:16,153 --> 00:46:19,054
Your music gets on
everybody's nerves anyway!

388
00:46:23,227 --> 00:46:26,890
Ouch, Mommy! Ouch! Help!

389
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,465
Nothing.

390
00:46:31,535 --> 00:46:34,265
Louder! Come on, hurry up!

391
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:43,112
Ouch! Mommy! Help!

392
00:46:49,653 --> 00:46:52,087
Marie, did you hurt yourself?

393
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:57,252
What's the big idea?

394
00:46:57,328 --> 00:47:00,695
Bettina thought that
maybe our parents aren't deaf.

395
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:05,463
Maybe they're spies
who were sent here to observe us.

396
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:08,096
We just tested Mommy.

397
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:11,471
Are you nuts?

398
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:13,066
What for?
Aren't you ashamed?

399
00:47:37,034 --> 00:47:41,937
She thinks it's funny. She also
made up crazy stuff when she was little.

400
00:47:50,347 --> 00:47:52,975
How's your work with children going?

401
00:47:54,018 --> 00:47:56,452
I think I'll stop teaching.

402
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,286
But that Keller girl
really improved with you.

403
00:48:00,357 --> 00:48:02,882
Her family moved to Frankfurt
a month ago.

404
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,554
The others aren't really interested.

405
00:48:05,629 --> 00:48:07,256
That's boring.

406
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:09,663
What do you think about it, Gregor?

407
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:15,262
Me? Yes, of course she's talented.

408
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:18,866
The kids are crazy about her,
but if she doesn't want to--

409
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,340
Don't let the pleasure principle
run your life!

410
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:28,783
You have to do something
besides spending your husband's money!

411
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:32,049
That isn't fair.
I've always earned my living.

412
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:33,419
Sure, but how?

413
00:48:37,027 --> 00:48:39,996
Sorry I didn't meet
your expectations, Dad.

414
00:48:40,064 --> 00:48:42,294
Money is not the subject here.

415
00:48:42,366 --> 00:48:45,335
Stop all the arguing, will you!

416
00:48:45,402 --> 00:48:47,802
After all,
it's Clarissa's birthday.

417
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,034
''After all, it's Christmas!''

418
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:54,509
It's not my fault
we only see each other on holidays!

419
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:59,715
If you had kids or a family--
What do you do all day?

420
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:02,809
- She cleans up.
- Exactly.

421
00:49:02,886 --> 00:49:05,184
You clean up, huh?

422
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:10,354
She'll have enough to do
when Lara comes for the summer.

423
00:49:10,427 --> 00:49:12,258
- Marie!
- What?

424
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:15,856
- Lara is staying with you?
- You haven't told them yet?

425
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:21,395
What are you talking about anyway?
Don't keep us in suspense.

426
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:27,569
- What hasn't Lara told us?
- Let me tell--

427
00:49:27,645 --> 00:49:30,637
You're afraid to.
Lara is spending the summer with me.

428
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:33,911
I'm preparing her
for the entrance exam...

429
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:36,817
and if all goes well, she'll attend
the conservatory in the fall.

430
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:40,983
Berlin?
Isn't there anything nearby?

431
00:49:41,058 --> 00:49:44,926
That's a good idea.
Lara's talent should be developed.

432
00:49:44,995 --> 00:49:47,293
Perhaps she'll
make something of herself.

433
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:49,696
But Berlin is far away.

434
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:53,635
You'd have to live there.
You want to move out?

435
00:49:53,704 --> 00:49:57,037
Lara is 1 8.
There's a time for everyone.

436
00:49:57,107 --> 00:49:59,541
It won't work
if Martin and Kai don't approve.

437
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:02,204
Do you have to stab me in the back?

438
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:04,213
Stab you in the back?

439
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:07,876
I'm happy I can say anything
in this family.

440
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:13,450
Leave her alone.
She's a wonderful clarinet player...

441
00:50:13,524 --> 00:50:15,458
and I want to help her.

442
00:50:15,526 --> 00:50:19,360
We'll pay for it.
Don't worry.

443
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:22,422
She has to get out of that nest.
She's looked after you long enough!

444
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:25,434
- Stop it, Clarissa!
- Why?

445
00:50:25,502 --> 00:50:30,439
That school is just right for her.
And you can visit her if you like.

446
00:50:30,507 --> 00:50:34,705
But we wanted to go to Italy
this summer.

447
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:39,715
This is more important.
Martin and Kai have to approve.

448
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:43,978
Lara shouldn't be handicapped
just because her parents are!

449
00:50:44,054 --> 00:50:48,457
I'm the father!
She is my daughter!

450
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:53,761
Sit down!

451
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:04,034
Clarissa, you went too far this time!

452
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:06,235
Sure, it's all my fault again.

453
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,143
He throws red wine in my face,
and you stand up for him!

454
00:51:13,817 --> 00:51:17,617
I wanted to tell you this evening,
but Clarissa told you first.

455
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:22,625
Nothing is decided yet.

456
00:51:22,693 --> 00:51:26,220
Clarissa wants me to apply
for the exam. That's all!

457
00:51:26,296 --> 00:51:28,457
She only wants to help me.

458
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,633
She isn't conceited.
That's nonsense!

459
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:40,234
Do you think you and Mom
can get along without me?

460
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:46,673
I treat you like a baby.

461
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,048
I can leave if I want to.

462
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:52,883
Then what's the reason?

463
00:52:00,497 --> 00:52:03,193
<i>I ruined their evening again.</i>

464
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:06,828
<i>They felt ashamed for me,</i>
<i>as always.</i>

465
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:09,737
Who cares?
It isn't important.

466
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:14,710
<i>Why Clarissa, of all people?</i>
<i>Don't you know how much it hurts me?</i>

467
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:18,145
I want to become a musician.
That's all.

468
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:24,820
Try to understand me.

469
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:30,384
<i>Sometimes I wish you were deaf.</i>

470
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:33,089
<i>Then you'd be totally in my world.</i>

471
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:52,481
It's mean that you're leaving. Now I
have to translate all of Mom's movies.

472
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:55,916
Stop whining!
You don't help out much anyway.

473
00:52:56,987 --> 00:53:01,185
Can I at least sleep in your bed
while you're gone?

474
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:03,226
If it makes you happy.

475
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:06,490
Yes, it does.
And don't touch my teddy bear.

476
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:20,142
Why do parents
only talk about homework?

477
00:53:37,594 --> 00:53:42,759
When I was little, I believed
that all grown-ups could sing.

478
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:46,462
I also thought I'd be able to
when I was a grown-up.

479
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:53,468
I'd stand in front of a mirror
and move my mouth...

480
00:53:53,544 --> 00:53:57,344
and pretend that wonderful sounds
were coming out--

481
00:53:58,448 --> 00:54:02,817
sounds that made people look
so ecstatic, so happy-- music!

482
00:54:06,623 --> 00:54:11,356
I danced in front of the mirror and held
a brush as if it were a microphone.

483
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:34,083
What's this, Mom?

484
00:54:37,821 --> 00:54:41,518
You don't know if I like this music.

485
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:45,926
It's a clarinet concert.
You read about it in the newspaper.

486
00:54:48,165 --> 00:54:51,931
I'm sure it will be very good.
But why two tickets?

487
00:54:55,138 --> 00:54:59,700
We'll have a nice evening.
It's wonderful you're coming along.

488
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,714
Thank you.

489
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:31,865
- It's nice you're here.
- Why didn't Clarissa come?

490
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:35,275
She isn't feeling so well
this morning.

491
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:43,146
Nothing serious.
She perks up after dark.

492
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:55,895
- Hello, Clarissa.
- Hello. This is my niece, Lara.

493
00:55:55,966 --> 00:56:00,869
Christian, Frederick, Wolfgang,
Anna, Babs, Susanne and Walter.

494
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:03,565
- Hello.
- Are you visiting in Berlin?

495
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,168
She wants to go to the conservatory, but
she has to get used to the city first.

496
00:56:14,284 --> 00:56:17,549
- You're a musician?
- Not yet.

497
00:56:17,621 --> 00:56:19,816
She plays the clarinet very well.

498
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:22,859
And now you want to see Berlin?

499
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:43,604
Lara, come here!

500
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:32,183
- This is my lake.
- Right in the middle of town!

501
00:58:32,255 --> 00:58:35,656
It's the only place
that makes me feel melancholy.

502
00:58:35,725 --> 00:58:38,717
It always reminds me of home.

503
00:58:38,795 --> 00:58:41,662
It froze over last winter.

504
00:58:49,973 --> 00:58:52,237
What if somebody comes?

505
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,562
Well?

506
00:59:53,637 --> 00:59:59,200
I don't like melancholy stuff. They ruin
my mood for the rest of the day.

507
00:59:59,276 --> 01:00:02,177
Don't worry.
I'll find you some nice pieces.

508
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:07,845
I don't know if I want to play
anything else. I like the music.

509
01:00:08,785 --> 01:00:11,117
- But you won't get accepted with that.
- Who says?

510
01:00:11,187 --> 01:00:15,453
I do. Or are you keen on depressing
the examiners to death?

511
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:18,050
I think they should accept you.

512
01:00:18,128 --> 01:00:21,825
This is ridiculous.
The greatest composers--

513
01:00:21,898 --> 01:00:24,366
Either believe me, or try it alone.

514
01:02:26,256 --> 01:02:29,987
<i>A stupid feeling</i>
<i>being stared at, huh?</i>

515
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,221
<i>I've been watching you.</i>

516
01:02:32,295 --> 01:02:34,229
<i>I noticed.</i>

517
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:45,705
<i>Hello. I'm Johanna.</i>
<i>Who are you?</i>

518
01:02:45,775 --> 01:02:47,902
<i>L-a-r-a.</i>

519
01:02:47,977 --> 01:02:50,411
<i>T-o-m.</i>

520
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,712
<i>We're going to the park, but he let me</i>
<i>take a quick look in here.</i>

521
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:57,082
<i>Right. And ''quick''is almost over.</i>

522
01:03:01,991 --> 01:03:05,290
- Can I help you?
- We'd like those gloves.

523
01:03:05,361 --> 01:03:07,158
Aren't you deaf?

524
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:09,931
Not me. You?

525
01:03:14,737 --> 01:03:17,262
- How much?
- Five marks. What do you want?

526
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:24,579
My father's deaf.
He raised me all by himself.

527
01:03:24,647 --> 01:03:27,741
And now I'm a teacher
at a school for the deaf.

528
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:31,116
We were actually supposed to work
on articulation today.

529
01:03:49,939 --> 01:03:52,533
In two months, I'll be gone anyway.

530
01:03:52,609 --> 01:03:55,703
I'm going to the Gallaudet School
in Washington for a semester.

531
01:03:55,778 --> 01:03:59,805
The deaf can study medicine,
art history, law--

532
01:03:59,883 --> 01:04:01,817
all in sign language.

533
01:04:01,885 --> 01:04:07,152
Americans recognize it as a language.
They're at least <i>2</i>0 years ahead of us.

534
01:04:07,223 --> 01:04:11,284
I always wanted a father
I could be proud of--

535
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:15,695
one who protected me from the world
and sang me to sleep every night.

536
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:19,667
One who can't understand why you like
Guns 'n Roses more than Beethoven.

537
01:04:19,736 --> 01:04:21,670
Exactly.

538
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:30,003
- 6:30. I have to go.
- 6:30. That's very late!

539
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:36,208
You can come visit me at school.
I'm there every day.

540
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:38,220
Perhaps.

541
01:05:19,596 --> 01:05:23,555
- I thought I'd visit you.
- This is Lara.

542
01:05:25,034 --> 01:05:29,596
She came for a visit.
She may become a teacher too.

543
01:05:31,774 --> 01:05:36,074
- Lie down.
- What should I do?

544
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:38,579
Lie down on the floor
on your stomach.

545
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:44,251
Or don't you want to take part?

546
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,254
Okay.

547
01:05:56,032 --> 01:05:57,966
Wait and close your eyes.

548
01:06:41,444 --> 01:06:45,346
Poor Lara.
I'm afraid she can't feel the music.

549
01:06:47,183 --> 01:06:50,016
Will you go to the movies
with me tomorrow?

550
01:07:11,607 --> 01:07:14,371
''At The Lake! Come And Join Me.''

551
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:19,313
Where did Gregor drive off to?

552
01:07:21,017 --> 01:07:22,985
He's looking for an apartment.

553
01:07:28,524 --> 01:07:31,891
He said he gets a toothache
from my music.

554
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:34,623
- They're all against us.
- Every one of them.

555
01:07:45,908 --> 01:07:48,900
Why didn't you and Gregor
have a baby?

556
01:07:54,384 --> 01:07:57,911
I don't know whose fault it was.
It never worked out.

557
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:04,222
Maybe Mother Nature didn't want
to entrust a baby to a mother like me.

558
01:08:08,765 --> 01:08:12,166
I did everything wrong.

559
01:08:12,235 --> 01:08:16,831
Martin has you, Kai,
Marie and a real home.

560
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:19,397
I have nothing.

561
01:08:19,475 --> 01:08:21,841
That's not true.

562
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:26,371
You have so much. You're pretty and
strong, and you make wonderful music.

563
01:08:26,449 --> 01:08:29,247
I always wanted to be like you.

564
01:08:45,668 --> 01:08:48,228
It was a nice movie, wasn't it?

565
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:53,071
- Didn't you like it?
- Movies like that somehow make me sad.

566
01:08:53,142 --> 01:08:55,235
Love stories with a happy ending
make you sad?

567
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:56,801
Yeah.

568
01:08:56,879 --> 01:09:01,873
They make me unhappy with what I have.
I mean, they make you so hopeful.

569
01:09:01,951 --> 01:09:05,079
Hope is a widespread evil.

570
01:09:05,154 --> 01:09:09,784
You have to be careful with your dreams.
Most of them never come true.

571
01:09:09,859 --> 01:09:13,522
Why so serious? You're not even <i>2</i>0
and talk like Mrs. Kowalschek.

572
01:09:13,596 --> 01:09:15,530
- Who?
- My caretaker.

573
01:09:15,598 --> 01:09:20,399
But she's 7 0, fat and ugly
and sits at the window with her poodle.

574
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:24,497
-Isn't there anything nice in your life?
-Very little.

575
01:09:24,574 --> 01:09:29,409
You're making me crazy,
you ungrateful creature!

576
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:32,744
Don't feel so sorry for yourself!.

577
01:09:32,815 --> 01:09:34,749
But I'm hungry.

578
01:09:56,205 --> 01:09:58,765
- I want a schnitzel!
- What? A schnitzel!

579
01:10:02,845 --> 01:10:06,110
- Two schnitzels, please.
- I don't have any money.

580
01:10:06,182 --> 01:10:07,843
It's on me.

581
01:10:07,917 --> 01:10:11,478
- Would you like ketchup on it?
- No, thank you.

582
01:10:24,033 --> 01:10:27,230
Gloria Gaynor!
I loved it when I was 1 4.

583
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:29,023
Come here.

584
01:12:36,966 --> 01:12:38,900
Come closer.

585
01:12:43,139 --> 01:12:46,370
Your mother had an accident
on her bike yesterday.

586
01:12:48,878 --> 01:12:51,574
She's dead.

587
01:14:12,862 --> 01:14:16,320
There's no sound, Dad.
It's soundless.

588
01:14:33,949 --> 01:14:37,282
It was a mistake for her
to ride a bike.

589
01:14:37,353 --> 01:14:40,618
She had problems
with her sense of balance.

590
01:14:42,391 --> 01:14:45,724
Are you trying to say it's my fault?

591
01:14:46,762 --> 01:14:49,560
Look at me!
Talk to me, damn it!

592
01:14:49,632 --> 01:14:51,964
You don't believe that!

593
01:15:28,404 --> 01:15:29,996
What should I do?

594
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,302
The music bothers you.

595
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:39,112
You don't want any music in your house?
In your house?

596
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:53,024
I'm sure I won't be home later
than 1 1 :00 if the bus is on time. Okay?

597
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:56,963
- Do you have to go?
- Yes. I haven't been out for months.

598
01:15:57,032 --> 01:16:01,969
And I'm about to go crazy.
Anyway, the tickets are from Mom.

599
01:16:02,037 --> 01:16:05,404
Why can't I go with you?
You have two.

600
01:16:05,474 --> 01:16:10,207
Someone has to stay with Dad.
You have to put him to bed.

601
01:16:11,046 --> 01:16:14,709
He can put himself to bed.
I'm not his baby-sitter.

602
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:17,479
Watch it, miss. Don't get cheeky.

603
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:21,485
- How do I look?
- Too flashy.

604
01:16:21,557 --> 01:16:26,426
- Really? Clarissa uses makeup too.
- Clarissa is good-looking.

605
01:16:27,496 --> 01:16:31,296
I love you.
You know that, don't you?

606
01:20:31,473 --> 01:20:33,031
Tom?

607
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:37,806
What are you doing here?

608
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:40,542
You rode past me on the bus.

609
01:20:40,616 --> 01:20:43,551
I wanted to see how you're doing.

610
01:20:44,786 --> 01:20:47,414
Your aunt told me that--

611
01:20:47,489 --> 01:20:49,855
I'm flying tomorrow evening.

612
01:20:51,627 --> 01:20:53,094
I'm very sorry--

613
01:20:55,097 --> 01:21:00,501
I just heard a wonderful concert.
I have to get into that school.

614
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:04,403
I just have to.
Do you think I'm good enough?

615
01:21:04,473 --> 01:21:08,773
- I've never heard you play.
- Shall I play for you now?

616
01:21:08,844 --> 01:21:11,574
- Now?
- Why not?

617
01:21:11,647 --> 01:21:15,344
There must be some advantage
in having deaf fathers.

618
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:19,877
- Well, you're in a good mood again.
- But my sister hears everything.

619
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:33,294
- Don't you need a light for the notes?
- I have everything in my head.

620
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:39,070
Don't judge me too harshly.
I just made this piece up.

621
01:23:52,908 --> 01:23:58,141
Can I stay in your apartment?
I have to prepare myself for the exam.

622
01:23:58,213 --> 01:24:01,148
- And I want to leave here.
- I've rented it to a friend.

623
01:24:01,216 --> 01:24:03,150
I can't let him down.

624
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:13,459
Hey. What's wrong with you?

625
01:24:15,397 --> 01:24:19,663
Little Lara,
why are you so terribly sad?

626
01:24:23,205 --> 01:24:26,663
The saddest things in life
are separations and deaths.

627
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:31,811
I don't want to say good-bye anymore.
I've had enough of that.

628
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:35,646
You aren't rid of me yet.
Our story's just beginning.

629
01:24:36,618 --> 01:24:40,884
What a great couple-- a clarinet player
and a teacher for the deaf.

630
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:46,316
I don't want you to go.

631
01:24:47,562 --> 01:24:50,224
I'm almost back.

632
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:23,453
- Where were you?
- I was out walking.

633
01:25:23,532 --> 01:25:29,027
- Aren't you a bit late?
- What? It's only 7:1 5.

634
01:25:29,104 --> 01:25:31,572
Was the concert nice?

635
01:25:36,044 --> 01:25:39,207
Yes. Around 1 <i>2</i>:00, I think.

636
01:25:41,516 --> 01:25:44,508
So what? I wasn't home by 1 1 :00.

637
01:25:44,586 --> 01:25:48,750
But I'm 1 8, and I can be
an hour late if I want.

638
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:57,124
You're allowed to do some things,
but not everything. Hey, what's up?

639
01:25:58,233 --> 01:26:00,201
But he won't allow you...

640
01:26:00,268 --> 01:26:04,432
to bring men home
to the living room.

641
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:06,565
Who was here?

642
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:17,108
What did I do wrong this time, Dad?
What do you hold against me?

643
01:26:17,185 --> 01:26:20,177
That I'm irresponsible?
That I'm egotistic...

644
01:26:20,255 --> 01:26:22,723
and that I only think of myself
and my music?

645
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:27,592
That I stabbed you and Mom in the back?
That I'm on Clarissa's side?

646
01:26:27,662 --> 01:26:31,996
Let me tell you something.
I can't stand it here--

647
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:35,264
your silent, reproachful looks,
your complaints.

648
01:26:35,337 --> 01:26:39,603
The silence here, the noise you make
when you read the paper--

649
01:26:39,674 --> 01:26:41,608
when you eat,
when you brush your teeth.

650
01:26:41,676 --> 01:26:44,270
This house is like a cage.

651
01:26:44,346 --> 01:26:46,177
Get out of here!

652
01:26:46,248 --> 01:26:48,182
I've had enough!

653
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:15,171
Yes?

654
01:27:15,243 --> 01:27:18,701
I'm looking for my aunt--
Clarissa Bischoff. Is she here?

655
01:27:19,915 --> 01:27:22,748
What are you doing here?
Come in.

656
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:30,789
Your uncle has chosen to live alone.

657
01:27:33,995 --> 01:27:37,522
You did the right thing.
Your music is more important.

658
01:27:37,599 --> 01:27:39,965
Martin will understand.

659
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:43,894
You have no idea.

660
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,668
- What's wrong now?
- You have no right to condemn him.

661
01:27:47,742 --> 01:27:51,439
You never even tried
to understand him.

662
01:27:51,513 --> 01:27:53,378
Lara, I want you to be free--

663
01:27:53,448 --> 01:27:56,542
What do you really want from me?

664
01:27:56,618 --> 01:28:01,146
Sometimes I think you want me
to study at that school for your sake.

665
01:28:01,222 --> 01:28:04,555
Nonsense! I want you to be good,
really good.

666
01:28:04,626 --> 01:28:08,790
Your problems only distract you
from your music.

667
01:28:08,863 --> 01:28:13,197
Sure. You want me to be good,
but not better than you.

668
01:28:14,436 --> 01:28:16,097
That's not fair.

669
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:21,404
That's why you oppose my music.
You think it's boring, depressing.

670
01:28:21,476 --> 01:28:26,413
If you were really interested, you would
have encouraged me, but you never did.

671
01:28:26,481 --> 01:28:30,178
Slow down, ladies.
No need to get excited.

672
01:28:30,251 --> 01:28:33,846
Shut up! You have no idea
what we're talking about!

673
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:37,055
Coffee?

674
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:38,752
Just like your father.

675
01:28:38,827 --> 01:28:41,660
- Now I see what you're really like.
- Exactly.

676
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:47,635
I'm my father's child
and not the daughter you never had.

677
01:28:47,702 --> 01:28:49,693
And most of all, I'm not you.

678
01:29:13,895 --> 01:29:16,557
My publishing company is over there.

679
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:21,095
You can sleep here.

680
01:29:26,141 --> 01:29:28,075
Sleep tight.

681
01:29:29,811 --> 01:29:32,905
My deadline is next month.
The publisher is impatient.

682
01:29:32,981 --> 01:29:36,815
- I'll only practice when you're gone.
- Practice whenever you want.

683
01:29:36,885 --> 01:29:40,651
After 1 <i>2</i> years with your aunt,
I can sleep no matter how noisy it is.

684
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:47,758
Do you regret having moved out?

685
01:29:50,999 --> 01:29:52,933
Not really.

686
01:29:54,002 --> 01:29:56,163
But maybe I will.

687
01:29:57,639 --> 01:29:59,607
Why did you leave?

688
01:30:02,043 --> 01:30:04,534
Clarissa has no need for me.

689
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:07,080
Her mind is filled with you,
Robert and Martin.

690
01:30:07,148 --> 01:30:09,639
But they always argue.

691
01:30:09,718 --> 01:30:14,178
Yet, I wish she had
loved me as much.

692
01:30:14,255 --> 01:30:19,784
Her damned health food got on my nerves
too. Everything's green in her fridge.

693
01:30:19,861 --> 01:30:23,524
I don't eat anything that's green,
besides chewing gum.

694
01:31:50,985 --> 01:31:52,475
Yes?

695
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:54,954
Marie! Where are you?

696
01:31:55,023 --> 01:31:58,618
Very near. Downtown.
Can you pick me up?

697
01:31:58,693 --> 01:32:02,424
- I don't know what subway to take.
- Are you okay?

698
01:32:02,497 --> 01:32:04,055
Yes.

699
01:32:05,333 --> 01:32:07,324
My goodness.

700
01:32:16,477 --> 01:32:19,605
Are you out of your mind?
Alone by train?

701
01:32:19,681 --> 01:32:23,208
- Why are you here anyway?
- To visit you.

702
01:32:23,284 --> 01:32:27,584
That's why you went 300 miles by train?
But I have no time.

703
01:32:30,725 --> 01:32:33,819
- Does Dad know you're here?
- Sure. I wrote him a note.

704
01:32:33,895 --> 01:32:36,762
What did you write?

705
01:32:36,831 --> 01:32:39,766
That I was going to a party
after school...

706
01:32:39,834 --> 01:32:44,168
but I didn't write that the party
was 300 miles away.

707
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:49,673
- What does he say?
- About what?

708
01:32:49,744 --> 01:32:52,736
You know.
Does he talk about me?

709
01:32:53,982 --> 01:32:56,382
I don't think what you said
was so nice either.

710
01:32:56,451 --> 01:33:01,286
Oh, shut up.
You don't have to tell me that too.

711
01:33:03,558 --> 01:33:06,857
Can you come back soon, please?

712
01:33:07,929 --> 01:33:12,059
- The exam is in a few days.
- And how do I get back home?

713
01:33:12,133 --> 01:33:14,829
What? Don't you have a return ticket?

714
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:20,807
I used up all my money.
And it's gonna be night soon.

715
01:33:20,875 --> 01:33:23,173
And I'm only nine.

716
01:33:26,581 --> 01:33:29,141
Oh, shit.

717
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:35,821
There's a problem sleeping here.

718
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:40,287
Come here and you'll see.

719
01:33:40,361 --> 01:33:42,693
We need your help.

720
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:48,133
Yes, a family affair.

721
01:33:51,639 --> 01:33:54,631
The tank is full.
I filled up yesterday.

722
01:33:56,844 --> 01:33:58,778
Are you good?

723
01:34:00,381 --> 01:34:02,008
Sure.

724
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:05,712
- It goes 1 40 miles per hour?
- But drive carefully.

725
01:34:07,088 --> 01:34:09,750
See you tomorrow.

726
01:34:09,824 --> 01:34:12,520
Take care, Marie. Say hi to Martin.

727
01:34:35,917 --> 01:34:39,284
<i>Other fathers are proud</i>
<i>of their daughters...</i>

728
01:34:39,354 --> 01:34:42,289
<i>when they're successful.</i>

729
01:34:42,357 --> 01:34:44,348
<i>Why don't you help me?</i>

730
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:04,236
You can't let me go in there alone.
Daddy will tear me apart.

731
01:35:04,312 --> 01:35:07,645
I drove you here. Now you walk
the last ten yards yourself.

732
01:35:07,715 --> 01:35:13,415
- Please.
- Go on. He'll be happy you're back.

733
01:35:41,249 --> 01:35:44,275
I drove Marie home.

734
01:35:44,352 --> 01:35:46,479
<i>Thank you.</i>

735
01:35:46,554 --> 01:35:50,422
Hey! Since when does Clarissa
know our language?

736
01:35:52,193 --> 01:35:55,788
<i>Is Lara still at your place?</i>
<i>Is she all right?</i>

737
01:35:55,863 --> 01:35:59,560
No, she's sad.

738
01:35:59,634 --> 01:36:01,568
She misses you.

739
01:36:03,204 --> 01:36:05,297
Come on. I'll take you to her.

740
01:36:05,373 --> 01:36:09,605
<i>Why didn't she come with you?</i>

741
01:36:09,677 --> 01:36:13,977
She doesn't have the time.
You have to go to her.

742
01:36:14,048 --> 01:36:17,814
Oh, yes! We'll all go
right back there together!

743
01:36:17,885 --> 01:36:20,149
<i>No, I can't.</i>

744
01:36:24,258 --> 01:36:27,022
Stop feeling sorry for yourself!.

745
01:36:27,095 --> 01:36:30,690
<i>It must be a family problem.</i>

746
01:36:44,812 --> 01:36:49,044
Oh, Daddy!
Why didn't you go there with her?

747
01:36:49,117 --> 01:36:52,052
<i>If you ever run away again...</i>

748
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:54,680
<i>I'll spank the living daylights</i>
<i>out of you.</i>

749
01:37:36,364 --> 01:37:39,527
- Which instrument?
- Clarinet.

750
01:37:41,602 --> 01:37:44,196
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

751
01:37:55,783 --> 01:37:58,479
Lara Bischoff.
Come with me, please.

752
01:38:06,394 --> 01:38:08,123
Miss Bischoff...

753
01:38:08,196 --> 01:38:12,963
in your application, you wrote you're
interested in traditional Idezmer music.

754
01:38:13,968 --> 01:38:19,338
- Why are you interested in it?
- That's hard to say. It's a feeling--

755
01:38:19,407 --> 01:38:22,103
Perhaps because it's so emotional.

756
01:38:22,176 --> 01:38:24,906
Emotional? Well, well.

757
01:38:24,979 --> 01:38:28,813
Inside it's joyful and wild,
and at the same time...

758
01:38:28,883 --> 01:38:31,852
it's sad and not really free.

759
01:38:31,919 --> 01:38:34,444
It's a feeling I understand
very well.

760
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:38,624
Do you know what I mean?

761
01:38:38,693 --> 01:38:41,161
Then let's begin
with your main subject.

762
01:38:41,229 --> 01:38:44,027
Miss Bischoff,
you've brought along three pieces?

763
01:38:44,098 --> 01:38:49,229
Yes. If you don't object,
I'll begin with the contemporary piece.

764
01:38:49,303 --> 01:38:53,205
As you wish.
The order is unimportant.

765
01:39:12,293 --> 01:39:15,660
<i>I want to see you play.</i>
<i>Is that okay?</i>

766
01:39:16,897 --> 01:39:19,297
We're waiting.

767
01:39:21,636 --> 01:39:23,069
Don't you feel well?

768
01:39:23,137 --> 01:39:27,198
Would you like some water?
Take a deep breath.

769
01:39:28,276 --> 01:39:32,303
Then begin.
It's not as bad as you think.

770
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:36,180
<i>Calm down.</i>
<i>I just want to wish you luck.</i>

771
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:39,515
What's going on?
Why did you come?

772
01:39:39,587 --> 01:39:42,317
<i>To see what's so important to you...</i>

773
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:45,154
<i>and to see how you play.</i>

774
01:39:49,797 --> 01:39:52,732
-Excuse me. Would you let us in on this?
-Yes.

775
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,394
That's my father. He's deaf.

776
01:39:55,469 --> 01:39:57,699
He'd like to watch.

777
01:40:00,508 --> 01:40:03,944
All right. If he'd like to.
But I must ask you to begin.

778
01:40:08,482 --> 01:40:11,747
<i>That's right.! Show them.!</i>

779
01:40:11,819 --> 01:40:16,552
Please, Dad. Stop talking.
I'm getting all mixed up.

780
01:42:01,862 --> 01:42:05,662
<i>So that's your music?</i>

781
01:42:07,034 --> 01:42:09,935
Yes, it's my music.

782
01:42:10,004 --> 01:42:12,905
Do you think you'll ever
be able to understand it?

783
01:42:12,973 --> 01:42:16,340
<i>Maybe I can't hear it...</i>

784
01:42:16,410 --> 01:42:20,710
<i>but I'll try to ''understand''it.</i>

785
01:42:29,056 --> 01:42:33,390
<i>Have I lost you?</i>

786
01:42:33,461 --> 01:42:38,023
I've loved you
ever since I was born.

787
01:42:38,098 --> 01:42:42,228
You'll never lose me.

788
01:43:00,621 --> 01:43:02,782
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>
